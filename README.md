This tool is for entering descriptive text in real time, for later analysis: 
Typical application is real time measurements like drive testing in cellular 
systems, where text entries can be entered to describe the testers experience 
(e.g. bus passing, passing corner X etc.). The logged time stamp is then used 
in the analysis phase, for better understanding of what is seen in the logged 
measurement data. 

The logged time stamps are in milliseconds from midnight. The log also 
contains the date and time for the last time the timestamper log was cleared.

When saving the time stamp, the file name is automatically generated in a format
where the save date and time is included.

timestamper should run in modern web browsers like Edge or Chrome, provided 
that javascript is enabled.

The timestamp of the serving machine is logged (typically your local PC). Logs 
are stored in the browsers protected memory, and can be read, stored to file 
and cleared with the buttons under the text entry.
